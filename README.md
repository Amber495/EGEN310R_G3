Design Decisions & Isses

Q. We had issues getting 
any new code to run correctly. 
Why wasn't the code running?

A. The bluetooth device 
wouldn't connect without 
unplugging the wired connection.

Q. We didn't initially 
have all of the pins 
working properly.
How do we get them to
work properly?

A. We did a wiring 
diagram to keep track
of everything correctly.

Q. We didn't understand
how to add in a servo
to the driving motors.
How can we get the 
servos to work?

A. We used a motor instead
because it wasn't powerful
enough. Also, we needed
a motor controller.
